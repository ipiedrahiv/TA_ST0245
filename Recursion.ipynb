    "# 1 RECURSION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 What is recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the repeated aplicarion of a **recursive** solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion in programming consist of calling the same method in order to solve smaller and smaller versions of the problem that wants to be solved, which then can be used to give the desired answer. So that this may work, the current problem must obey two rules:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1) Recursive case: It can be broken down into smaller version of itself.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2) Base case: It has at least one known stop point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Recursion and iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of repeating the same block of instructions over and over might sound familiar to you, you probably have already encountered this sort of solution when working with for, while, and do-while loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put in simple terms, a recursive function uses a base case, a recursive case and parameters to solve a problem by calling itself over and over, while an iterative function uses a counter, a stopping condition and an increment to repeat some part of the code by using a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been proven that any iterative algorithm can be written recursively, this is why in functional programming loops are said to be a particular case of recusrion called *tail-recursive*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is not the easiest concept to grasp, so perhaps a day to day example might help before we get into the more thechnical ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are on a really large classroom, and you want to know hay many rows in the room, counting them looks like too much trouble, so you ask the person in front of you how many rows they count up until their own. They don't want to do it either, so they ask the person in front of them, who does the same, and this goes on and on until they reach the person on first row, who sayd when asked \"None\". This way the answer makes its way back up, the person who asked the person in the first row know they only needs to add one to the answer, and the person behind them also has to do just that, and so after this long game of hot potato you on the very back row, get to know the answer without doing the counting one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the base case would represent a point where there are no rows to count, which would be the first row. The recursive case would be finding the amount of rows in front of the row in front of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets go on to some more thechnical examples, from now on I'll provide you with a solved exercise and a similar one for you to work on.\n"
